## üöÄ Techs

Using the following technologies

- LaTex
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Python (MANIM)

## üíª About

Application developed to apply for a full Rocketseat scholarship. Where I proposed a solution in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãeducation to solve a problem in the field of exact sciences.

## ü§î Problem

For those who study physics or mathematics, among others, there is the problem of sending lists of exercises and carrying out the discursive tests. What has been done is writing on paper and then scanning the document.

<br>

The solution would be a platform that allows you to easily type mathematical expressions, using the LaTex language, but without having to write scripts in LaTex. In addition, for the teacher not to have to correct such a large volume of questions, a "tutor robot" would be interesting, which would elaborate the questions and correct discursive questions (using an AI).

<br>

To sketch this "toy model", I reused the Origin project in NLW6, modifying some things like 3D effects, dark theme and a video, which is an animation that I built in Python, using the MANIM library. I also used a JS library that allows writing LaTex scripts on web pages, here I just used it to write "LaTex" in a stylized way.
